## Who is Noah Kagan?

- early @ Facebook, Mint; founder, AppSumo
- fired from [Fb](http://okdork.com/justlively), "lost out" ~$150MM, but it was a great thing to happen to him (devil's advocate: retroactive rationalization)
- Jess sent him a headset for the podcast which he thought was a nice touch of putting the extra effort in vs. doing what everyone else does

## Figuring out what you care about

### Purpose & fulfillment

- **generation of moving**: we just quit jobs that don't feel purposeful to us
- he quit, moved to Argentina and just drank wine and tangoed for 4 months -- realized he hadn't found his purpose yet
- "I made the most money when I wasn't trying to make money."
- people that aren't very fulfilled avoid taking responsibility by placing it on external things (e.g., "My boss did...", "The economy's down")
- 2 tests for fulfillment:
  - **the sunday test**: how do you feel about Monday?
  - **the drive test**: how do you feel driving to work Monday morning?
- saw his mom unsatisfied as a nurse... it's absurd that most Americans hate their jobs

### Facebook & intentional conversations

- submitted resume to Fb to be employee #30 with a bunch of changes he would make to their site & brought examples of other sites he'd been creating *[vs. 99% of people that just send their resume + hope]*
- tip: research person before you interview / talk (and promise them tacos)
- fired from Fb, but it was very challenging & high growth

### Clarity & distractions

- when we're not sure what we want, we fill our time with distractions: drinks, calendar events -- what if we actually did nothing? (vs. things that don't help you get clarity)
- people, often women, question themselves for feeling constrained by the external limitation of not being able to check every item on a checklist of requirements (do you even really care about the checklist?)

### Money, freedom, and happiness

- on missing out on $150MM from Fb: his therapist instructed, "make a list of the things you would buy if you had that money," then they discussed item-by-item "could you buy it now?" --> concluded that there wasn't anything in his life he was really missing from that money [aligns with Jason Fried's thought that [freedom of lifestyle is the new luxury](https://github.com/tedmiston/notes/blob/master/books/Remote.md#the-new-luxury)]
- a lot of people want freedom of "work from anywhere and do whatever I want and not have a boss", but people instead tie it to making $x/mo., then they aren't actually happy once they get there
- no magical one thing that will trigger all of your happiness -- how do you want to enjoy the process of life?

## Getting there

### Outcomes vs. intentional values

- outcomes are often out of your control, and achievements are fleeting ("what's next?"), but the enjoyment is in having an **enduring value** that you embody"
  - ex. "How do you want to be simpler?"
  - ex. valuing a healthy lifestyle vs. the outcome of a six pack
- his therapist asks, "What do you want?" every 2 weeks in each of:
  1. relationships
  2. health
  3. work
- try a value for 30 days -- how does it make your life better / worse?
- he wrote what he wanted this year on his whiteboard + desktop background
- **vision boards** can be motivational, but can also lead to too much focus on fickle outcomes vs. real values
- launched KingSumo.com - A/B test headlines for blog posts, but initial conversion was low... always still learning

### Learning & growth

- the experiences you learn and grow from are *"the hot sauce of life"*, not when everything just works
- grew up in SF but left because "7 figures is a lifestyle business there"
- values in Austin: I feel very satisfied when I create, and I go to SF + NYC from time to time to get inspired, then bring it back home
- his advice:
  1. If your job isn't satisfying, learn why not -- he writes primarily or goes to therapist.
  2. Figure out what it is you want to be doing -- every week ask, "What do I want?"  If you don't know what you want, don't fill time with distractions; start being intentional with physical / mental creativity.
  3. Talk with a brutally honest friend.  Filter out all inputs in life into what you actually do.  Power & strength come from internal decision: "This is what I want & I'm going to do it."
- if he hadn't been fired from Fb, he would have missed out on Thailand, Russia, Argentina, Mint, AppSumo, experiencing people he wouldn't have otherwise (but what about the other opportunity cost...)
- money doesn't help you be happy with yourself -- what activities do you do?  what people are you around?  how do you feel good with yourself?
- if it's not there, how do you start crafting it with intentional values?: "Why are we doing the things we're doing now?"

## Closing questions

### What doubts & resistance have you faced in life?

- his dad had a business, made a lot of money, then sabotaged it -- doesn't want that to be him
- **Embrace what you're good at** -- "I'm really good at starting, but how do I surround myself with people who like finishing?"

### What would you tell someone who's just starting out?

- hustle... just start working; if you really want something, put the effort in
