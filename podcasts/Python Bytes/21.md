## 1. PyMOTW 3 - Performance Analysis

- [Python 3 Module of the Week (PyMOTW 3)](https://pymotw.com/3/)
- Written by Doug Hellmann; same format as PyMOTW but now focused on Python 3
- Recently covered profiling / performance analysis with `profile`, `cProfile`, and `pstats`
	- Python 2 - https://pymotw.com/2/profile/
	- Python 3 - https://pymotw.com/3/profile/
- Pyramid has a debug toolbar with request profiling

## 2. API Star

- https://github.com/tomchristie/apistar
- Tom Christie's new experimental _Python 3-first_ web framework which makes use of type annotations throughout
- Faster than [Sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic)
	- [Sanic - Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/sanic.html)
	- [Getting started with Sanic: the asynchronous, uvloop based web framework for Python 3.5+](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/12/getting-started-with-sanic-the-asynchronous-uvloop-based-web-framework-for-python-3-5.html)

## 3. On Python being slow

- [Yes, Python is Slow, and I Don’t Care – Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/yes-python-is-slow-and-i-dont-care-13763980b5a1)
- You can write code ~~faster~~ more quickly in Python and developer time is more expensive than CPU time
- Python is usually not the bottleneck, but when things are slow you have options (profile, optimize, swap interpreter, etc)

## 4. Hashing

- [A Quick Introduction: Hashing – Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/a-quick-introduction-hashing-c32d1dc91871)
- Fingerprinting static content for caching on the web

## 5. Wedding automation

- [Wedding at Scale: How I Used Twilio, Python and Google to Automate My Wedding](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/04/wedding-at-scale-how-i-used-twilio-python-and-google-to-automate-my-wedding.html)
- Collects contact info of wedding attendees in a Google Sheet accessed via [gspread](https://github.com/burnash/gspread), then uses Twilio to notify guests for RSVP, with text responses processed by a Flask app

## 6. Alexa in Python

- [python-alexa: A Python framework for Alexa Development](https://blog.njsnet.co/python-alexa/)
- https://github.com/nmyster/python-alexa
- A framework for creating Alexa skills in Python created by Neil Stewart
