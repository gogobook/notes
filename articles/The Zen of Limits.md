limits force us to figure out what's important

---

- forms (the rules) of zen meditation are a bipolar issue: people like them or spite them
- his personal limits (e.g., owning 50 things) serve a similar purpose
- "Some people embrace these limits. Other minimalists reject them because they’re too arbitrarily restricting, or they’re not the point of minimalism."
- "Limits are not the point of minimalism, but they accomplish something important: they force us to figure out what’s important. And if we don’t want to figure out what’s important, they force us to figure out why."
