How do we find motivation in the world?

---

- Sometimes people don't feel motivated if they focus too much on the rewards involved rather than the task itself
- Instead of focusing on the reward, how can we motivate ourselves to care about the task at hand?
- 3 ways:
  - 1. **Autonomy**: being able to self-direct our own life
  - 2. **Mastery**: getting better at something meaningful
  - 3. **Purpose**: doing something in service of a greater cause
- **The progress principle**: the most powerful motivator is making progress in meaningful work (even just the perception of doing so)
- From [_The Progress Principle_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/142219857X):

  > People’s inner work lives seemed to lift or drag depending on whether or not their projects moved forward, even by small increments. Small wins often had a surprisingly strong positive effect, and small losses a surprisingly strong negative one.

- If it's hard to see progress, focus on small accomplishments instead of big goals
- What is intrinsically motivating to you?
- In a study by Barry Schwartz on West Point grads, intrinsically motivated students performed better and were more satisfied than extrinsically motivated and those with hybrid intrinsic/extrinsic motivation
- From [_Drive_](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805) by Dan Pink:

  > So there is this kind of interesting zen-like thing. The route to these rewards is not to be cognitive of the rewards.

- Extra motivation from Neil deGrasse Tyson:

  > The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation.
