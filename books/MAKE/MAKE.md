*How to build, launch, grow and monetize a bootstrapped startup*<br>
by [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/) (@levels.io), 2016

- [MAKEbook.io](https://makebook.io/) &larr; pre-order
- [AMA on Product Hunt (September 2015)](https://www.producthunt.com/live/pieter-levels)

Pieter experimentally launched "12 startups in 12 months" and this is his story of what worked and what didn't.  He combines some accepted startup ideas (gauging traction before building, seeking recurring revenue) with some contrarian ones (building without writing code, storytelling vs. press releases, growing organically).
