## Introduction

- If you want to invest like Warren Buffet, "Buy either Berkshire Class A or Class B stock."
  - [BRK-A](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/brk-a) (~$217,370); [BRK-B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/brk-b) (~$145)
- "Buffett also says that most individual investors should purchase stock index funds because they are very low cost and they outperform most professional investment managers."
- This book was born from a course presented by the author at WUSTL
- It's not about Buffet's investing, but rather his business management style, practices, and principles
- Mostly a compilation of Buffet's own words from Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letters from 1977–2008

> We both insist on a lot of time being available almost everyday to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. We read and think. So Warren and I do more reading and thinking and less doing than most people in business. We do that because we like that kind of life.
>
> —Charlie Munger

- Buffet has constructed a life doing what he loves in a way that's comfortable and productive
- Wakes up ~6:45 am, reads the papers, sometimes the web
- Arrives at the office ~8–9 am, but no set schedule and no meetings first thing in the morning "I don't want to live that way."
- He wouldn't want to head a company like IBM or General Motors because your life becomes taken up by things you don't have a choice about
- 75–85% of the day is spent reading, the rest is on the phone buying/selling, then he goes home to play bridge or read more
- Doesn't leave at a set time "I don't like to be structured."
- Plays bridge online (as "T-Bone") with Bill Gates ("Chalengr"):

> I would pay $5 million a year for the ability to play on-line bridge 12 hours a week. It's worth it to me. If I compare it to the cost of a second home, that would mean nothing to me. If I deliver 12 hours of enjoyment playing bridge with my sister in Carmel, or whomever, doing it in a few seconds, clicking it on, I would pay it. They can't figure it out, so I'm paying about $95 a year.

- His son Howard never saw him mow the grass, wash a car, etc; when he got older, he understood the value of time better and how valuable Warren's time is
- "Though in the public spotlight, Buffett was standing guard over a still uncommonly private life. So unlike the modern CEO, he did block out his time in advance, preferring to keep it unencumbered."

> Richard Simmons, president of the Washington Post Co., was amazed by the quiet in Buffett's emerald green sanctum. He did not have an electronic calculator, a stock terminal, or a computer. "I am a computer," he noted to an interviewer.

- Compared to the average CEO, Buffet is time rich:

> His day was a veritable stream of unstructured hours and cherry colas. He would sit at the redwood horseshoe desk and read for hours, joined to the world by a telephone (which he answered himself) and three private lines: to Salomon Brothers, Smith Barney, and Goldman Sachs.
