## Front Matter

### Introduction: Become the Master of Change

#### The One Problem

- If you could take a magic wand to your life, what would you change?  What's stopping you from doing it?
- **Mind Movie**: thoughts play through our mind like a movie pulling us between instant gratification and longterm goals
- This mental projector creates idealized expectations from fantasy that don't align with reality
- The mind seeks comfort and avoids discomfort, fear, and change
- Fear causes us to avoid and procrastinate on what we really want
- It's the root of any problem we have in life
- This leads to:
  - anxiety
  - procrastination
  - avoiding fulfilling activities like chasing dreams, creative pursuits, and failing at habit change
- Solving it is the key to removing obstacles from our lives
- You can come to associate discomfort with learning and growth (**growth mindset**)
- "Learning to turn from the Mind Movie to reality, and appreciate reality for what it is, changed my life.  I could now act without fear, make changes without procrastination."

#### What this book will teach you

- How to form mindful habits to master the skills of discomfort & change, the **Zen Habits Method**

#### How to use this book

- **Slow change**: one step per chapter

#### The Challenge: Commit to making a small change
