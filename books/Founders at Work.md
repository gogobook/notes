# Founders at Work
*Stories of Startups' Early Days*<br>
by Jessica Livingston

---

## Introduction

- This book is about founders' stories in their own words, and the patterns she observed
- The goal is to inspire future founders
- Many founders were uncertain about starting a company or sure they were doing something big, just sure that they wanted to *fix something broken* or make something good
- **Determination** is the most important personality trait because you must be able to persevere when nothing goes according to plan, uncertainty, isolation, rejection, etc.
- **Innovation** is something people like abstractly but resist concretely because it differs from what they know
- Web-based email was once dismissed as unpromising

> Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you'll have to ram them down people's throats.
>
> -Howard Aiken

- **Adaptability** is important because most startups change their ideas rather than grow from a brilliant seedling
  - PayPal started as encryption software
  - Flickr started as a game
- Successful founders get rich but care more about changing the world and craftsmanship
- In the business world, startups are *the essence of productivity*
