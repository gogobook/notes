### Tips

\# | Tip | Description
--- | --- | ---
1 | **Care About Your Craft** | Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?
2 | **Think! About Your Work** | Turn off the autopilot and take control.  Constantly critique and appraise your work.
3 | **Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses** | Instead of excuses, provide options.  Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done.
4 | **Don't Live with Broken Windows** | Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.
5 | **Be a Catalyst for Change** | You can't force change on people.  Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.
6 | **Remember the Big Picture** | Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's happening around you.
7 | **Make Quality a Requirements Issue** | Involve your users in determining the project's real quality requirements.
8 | **Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio** | Make learning a habit.
9 | **Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear** | Don't be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma.  Analyze information in terms of you and your project.
10 | **It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It** | There's no point in having great ideas if you don't communicate them effectively.
11 | **DRY—Don't Repeat Yourself** | Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
12 | **Make It Easy to Reuse** | If it's easy to reuse, people will.  Create an environment that supports reuse.
13 | **Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things** | Design components that are self-contained, independent, and have a single, well-defined purpose.
14 | **There Are No Final Decisions** | No decision is cast in stone.  Instead, consider each as being written in the sand at the beach, and plan for change.
15 | **Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target** | Tracer bullets let you hone in on your target by trying things and seeing how close they land.
16 | **Prototype to Learn** | Prototyping is a learning experience.  Its value lies not in the code you produce, but in the lessons you learn.
17 | **Program Close to the Problem Domain** | Design and code in your user's language.
18 | **Estimate to Avoid Surprises** | Estimate before you start.  You'll spot potential problems up front.
19 | **Iterate the Schedule with the Code** | Use experience you gain as you implement to refine the project time scales.
20 | **Keep Knowledge in Plain Text** | Plain text won't become obsolete.  It helps leverage your work and simplifies debugging and testing.
21 | **Use the Power of Command Shells** | Use the shell when graphical user interfaces don't cut it.
22 | **Use a Single Editor Well** | The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable, extensible, and programmable.
23 | **Always Use Source Code Control** | Source code control is a time machine for your work—you can go back.
24 | **Fix the Problem, Not the Blame** | It doesn't really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else's—it is still your problem, and it still needs to be fixed.
25 | **Don't Panic When Debugging** | Take a deep breath and THINK! about what could be causing the bug.
26 | **"select" Isn't Broken** | It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library.  The bug is most likely in the application.
27 | **Don't Assume It—Prove It** | Prove your assumptions in the actual environment with real data and boundary conditions.
28 | **Learn a Text Manipulation Language** | You spend a large part of each day working with text.  Why not have the computer do some of it for you?
29 | **Write Code That Writes Code** | Code generators increase your productivity and help avoid duplication.
30 | **You Can't Write Perfect Software** | Software can't be perfect.  Protect your code and users from the inevitable errors.
31 | **Design with Contracts** | Use contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less than it claims to do.
32 | **Crash Early** | A dead program normally a lot less damage than a crippled one.
33 | **Use Assertions to Prevent the Impossible** | Assertions validate your assumptions.  Use them to protect your code from an uncertain world.
34 | **Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems** | Exceptions can suffer from all the readability and maintainability problems of classic spaghetti code.  Reserve exceptions for exceptional things.
35 | **Finish What You Start** | Where possible, the routine or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.
36 | **Minimize Coupling Between Modules** | Avoid coupling by writing "shy" code and applying the Law of Demeter.
37 | **Configure, Don't Integrate** | Implement technology choices for an application as configuration options, not through integration or engineering.
38 | **Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata** | Program for the general case, and put the specifics outside the compiled code base.
39 | **Analyze Workflow to Improve Concurrency** | Exploit concurrency in your user's workflow.
40 | **Design Using Services** | Design in terms of services—independent, concurrent objects behind well-defined consistent interfaces.
41 | **Always Design for Concurrency** | Allow for concurrency, and you'll design cleaner interfaces with fewer assumptions.
42 | **Separate Views from Models** | Gain flexibility at low cost by designing your application in terms of models and views.
43 | **Use Blackboards to Coordinate Workflow** | Use blackboards to coordinate disparate facts and agents, while maintaining independence and isolation among participants.
44 | **Don't Program by Coincidence** | Rely only on reliable things.  Beware of accidental complexity, and don't confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.
45 | **Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms** | Get a feel for how long things are likely to take before you write code.
46 | **Test Your Estimates** | Mathematical analysis of algorithms doesn't tell you everything.  Try timing your code in its target environment.
47 | **Refactor Early, Refactor Often** | Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it.  Fix the root of the problem.
48 | **Design to Test** | Start thinking about testing before you write a line of code.
49 | **Test Your Software, or Your Users Will** | Test ruthlessly.  Don't make your users find bugs for you.
50 | **Don't Use Wizard Code You Don't Understand** | Wizards can generate reams of code.  Make sure you understand all of it before you incorporate it into your project.
51 | **Don't Gather Requirements—Dig for Them** | Requirements rarely lie on the surface.  They're buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.
52 | **Work with a User to Think Like a User** | It's the best way to gain insight into how the system will really be used.
53 | **Abstractions Live Longer than Details** | Invest in the abstraction, not the implementation.  Abstractions can survive the barrage of changes from different implementations and new technologies.
54 | **Use a Project Glossary** | Create and maintain a single source of all the specific terms and vocabulary for a project.
55 | **Don't Think Outside the Box—Find the Box** | When faced with an impossible problem, identify the real constraints.  Ask yourself: "Does it have to be done this way?  Does it have to be done at all?"
56 | **Start When You're Ready** | You've been building experience all your life.  Don't ignore niggling doubts.
57 | **Some Things Are Better Done than Described** | Don't fall into the specification spiral—at some point you need to start coding.
58 | **Don't Be a Slave to Formal Methods** | Don't blindly adopt any technique without putting it into the context of your development practices and capabilities.
59 | **Costly Tools Don't Produce Better Designs** | Beware of vendor hype, industry dogma, and the aura of the price tag.  Judge tools on their merits.
60 | **Organize Teams Around Functionality** | Don't separate designers from coders, testers from data modelers.  Build teams the way you build code.
61 | **Don't Use Manual Procedures** | A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time.
62 | **Test Early, Test Often, Test Automatically** | Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans that sit on a shelf.
63 | **Coding Ain't Done 'Til All the Tests Run** | 'Nuff said.
64 | **Use Saboteurs to Test Your Testing** | Introduce bugs on purpose in a separate copy of the source to verify that testing will catch them.
65 | **Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage** | Identify and test significant program states.  Testing lines of code isn't enough.
66 | **Find Bugs Once** | Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug.  Automatic tests should check for it from then on.
67 | **English is Just a Programming Language** | Write documents as you would write code: honors the DRY principle, use metadata, MVC, automatic generation, and so on.
68 | **Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On** | Documentation created separately from code is less likely to be correct and up to date.
69 | **Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations** | Come to understand your users' expectations, then deliver just that little bit more.
70 | **Sign Your Work** | Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work.  You should be, too.
