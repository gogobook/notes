Kevin Rose's early-stage startup investment strategy is largely emotional vs a specific investment thesis like "Software is eating the world."  Instead he asks questions like, "Do you think this technology will be more or less a part of our lives in 3 years?" as a prerequisite before due diligence.

> When evaluating a new product, I take the novel features (not every feature) and exhaustively play out how they might impact the emotions of the consumers who use them. After that, I take the same features and consider how they might evolve over time.

For example, his investment in Twitter in 2008 was motivated by: (1) quick public sharing (tweets), (2) following vs bidirectional friendship, (3) syndication beyond one's own social graph (retweets).

He's avoided investing in VR because current gear is bulky, clunky, or otherwise doesn't pass the emotional test for mainstream adoption: the experience isn't a 10x of traditional gaming.
