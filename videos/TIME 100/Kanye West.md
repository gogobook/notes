> "Every time I say something that's extremely truthful out loud, it literally breaks the internet... so what are we getting all of the rest of the time?"

- "What can we do to make life easier for each other, to make life doper for our kids?"
- "We were born into a broken world, and we're like a cleanup crew."
- Learned to produce on an Amiga because growing up he wanted to make video games
- "What's the main thing that makes magic _magic_? The fact that no one believes it's possible."
- On his initial rejection in fashion, said to his publicist:

> "Remember this moment because it won't always be like this.  Embrace this moment where no one came to see the collection.  I take things that people look at as a negative as an inspiration to do something better."

- "Our focus should be less about what our legacy is going to be and more on how we can give to each other."
